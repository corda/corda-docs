# Corda Enterprise Network Manager release notes

## Corda Enterprise Network Manager 1.5

Corda Enterprise Network Manager (CENM) 1.5 introduces a number of new features and enhancements, including a new [CENM Console](cenm-console.md), single sign-on for Azure AD for Corda services, and the ability to reissue node legal identity keys and certificates.

While this release is backward-compatible, you should consider upgrading to this release from earlier versions of the Corda Enterprise Network Manager.

### New features and enhancements

#### CENM Console

The [CENM Console](cenm-console.md) is a new CENM web UI that enables you to view CSR and CRR requests, display nodes in the network map, run a flag day, and update services configuration.

#### Single sign-on for Azure AD

CENM 1.5 introduces support for Azure Active Directory (AAD) as a Single sign-on (SSO) for the CENM [Auth Service](auth-service.md), which supports full Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and provides a web-based management interface for system administrators to create and manage user groups and entitlements. As a result, you can now operate a SSO set-up between Corda services and Azure AD, with a simple configuration to both your Azure AD and Corda Auth services.

#### Certificate rotation: ability to reissue node legal identity keys and certificates

Corda Enterprise 4.7 introduces a capability for reissuing node legal identity keys and certificates, allowing CENM to re-register a node (including a notary node) with a new certificate in the Network Map.

{{< warning >}}
The introduction of this functionality may require changes to your custom Identity Manager Workflow Plugins, regardless of using certificate reissuance functionality in your system. Make sure to check the [Upgrading Corda Enterprise Network Manager](upgrade-notes.md) page.

### Fixed issues

* We have fixed an issue where Network Map Service updates were stuck after more than approximately 1300 nodes were registered.
* We have fixed an issue where the Network Map Service was not fully started during CENM deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.

### Known issues

* When deploying a Network Map using the CENM Command-line Interface (CLI) Tool, the signing process for the Network Map could fail with the following error: "No NETWORK_PARAMETERS type signing process set up". The workaround for this issue is to stop the Angel Service and the Signing Service, and to manually kill the `signer.jar` process.
* The CENM Command-line Interface (CLI) Tool signing request `status` command fails when used for asynchronous signing.
* Running the CENM Command-line Interface (CLI) Tool command to cancel network parameters (`./cenm netmap netparams update cancel`) returns no message so it is unclear if it was run successfully or not.
* Insufficient revocation details are provided about signing a CRL after a revocation submission request is run by the CRR tool.
* The CENM Command-line Interface (CLI) Tool does not return a message if a token has expired when running `signer` commands.
* The Identity Manager Service shows an incorrect error when the `workflow.enmListener.port` parameter is missed.
* When setting up CENM services with Shell support, the Signing Service and the Network Map Service hang after running the `shutdown` command.
* When a CSR is rejected with a [rejection code](workflow.md#certificate-signing-request-rejection-reasons) between 1 and 11 via the JIRA workflow, the node notification is incorrect - the `Additional remark` field output contains technical data instead of a description of the rejection reason.
