# FARM Service

The Front-end Application Remote Management (FARM) service provides a gateway between front-end CENM service interfaces, such as the User Admin tool, and the [Auth Service](auth-service) that underpins authentication and authorisation in CENM services.

Once installed and configured, users interact with the FARM service when they want to specify the required **Context** for their CENM service tasks.

## Install the FARM service

You can install the FARM service by installing the FARM service `.jar` file:

`java -jar farm-application.jar -f config.conf`

### Configure the FARM service

When you configure the FARM service, you need to:

1. Specify the endpoint where the Auth service is exposed - this must match the IP or host name of the machine/VM/container and the port that is configured in the Auth Service config file.

2. Specify the SSL configuration for connecting to the Auth service. This is normally generated by the [PKI tool](pki-tool).

3. Your authentication credentials, as specified in your [Auth Service configuration](auth-service).

4. Your Zone Service address.

You can create a configuration file as shown in the sample, and then add this to your CENM services using the command line commands below.

```
# Configuration dependent on the Auth service install
auth {
    # This is the endpoint where the auth service is exposed, should be the IP or host name of
    # the machine/VM/container and the port that was configured in the auth service conf file
    serverUrl = "https://auth-service:8081/"
    # SSL config for connecting to the auth service
    # Should be the same trust store that is used when configuring the auth service
    # Generally generated by the PKI Tool
    sslConfig = {
        trustStore = "/usr/farm/certificates/corda-ssl-trust-store.jks"
        trustStorePassword = "trustpass"
    }
    # Client credentials that were configured in the auth service conf file like so:
    # clientConfig = {
    #   clients = [
    #       {
    #           clientId = "farm1"
    #           clientSecret = "secret1"
    #           scopes = [
    #               "accounts:admin"
    #           ]
    #           audience = [
    #               "zone",
    #               "network-map",
    #               "identity-manager"
    #           ]
    #       }
    #   ]
    clientCredentials = {
        clientId = "farm1"
        clientSecret = "secret1"
    }
}

# CENM zone-service address
cenm {
    zoneHost: "zone-service"
    # Admin listener port of the zone service
    zonePort: 5063
}

# port to bind to (defaults to 8080)
server {
    port = 8080
}
```
