# Corda Transactions

After the Buyer has decided what they would like to buy, they need to initiate a Propose Corda Transaction. We show corda transactions as a set of duplicated actions in the swim lane of each participant in the corda transaction with the corda logo in the corner.

We join the actions with a two way dashed line. In BPMN dashed lines denote messages and are normally unidirectional. However, in the CorDapp BPMN view we want to reflect that there a series of back and forth messages which result in a finalised transaction on the ledger so we use a two way arrow.

In addition we mark up which party initiated the transaction and annotate the message line on the Initiator end with a blue box giving more details about how thr transaction was formed, typically what flow is invoked and what the command in the transaction should be.

In our example you can see that the Buyer will initiate the ProposeFlow to create a Propose transaction.
