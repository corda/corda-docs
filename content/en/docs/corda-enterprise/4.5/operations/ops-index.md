# Corda Enterprise Operations Guide

The Corda Operations Guide is intended to assist you and your organisation in planning, deploying, and operating an
instance of Corda Enterprise. Much of the material you can read here is expanded upon throughout the docs, and can be readily found using a search on this documentation site. Wherever there is more material available on a particular subject, you can follow a link for the complete documentation.

There are three sections in this guide:

- Project planner documentation

- Operations and deployment guide

- Monitoring and logging

## Project planner documentation

The project planner documentation advises users on the requirements of their deployment.
