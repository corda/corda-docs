# Metering Collection Tool

The Metering Collection Tool is used to collect metering data from a Corda Enterprise node. This page describes how
the node records metering data, and how to run the collection tool in order to collect that data.

The tool is distributed as part of Corda Enterprise 4.5 with the name `corda-tools-metering-collector-4.5.jar`. This JAR must be placed in the nodeâ€™s
`cordapps` folder.

Note that Corda Enterprise nodes record metering data regardless of whether this tool is installed.


### Metering Data

Metering within Corda Enterprise is based on the signing of transactions. The act of signing over a transaction is referred to as a
*signing event*. Whenever a signing event occurs, a small piece of data is recorded by the node. This describes which entity signed the
transaction, what CorDapps and commands were involved, and what time this occurred. Note that signing events are recorded on a per-node
basis, so transaction signatures applied by a remote node will only have metering data recorded for those signatures on that node. Note
also that the time at which a transaction is signed is not exposed outside of the node.

Notaries running Corda Enterprise are also metered. In this case, data is recorded indicating what notarisation requests have been made
and who made them.


### Overview of the Metering Collection Tool

The Metering Collection Tool provides a mechanism for collecting metering data from both normal nodes and notaries running Corda Enterprise.
The tool provides several flows:

* `MeteringCollectionFlow` is used to collect metering data from a node using the node's shell (or connecting to it with the external shell). It takes in a time window over which to collect data, and optionally a set of CorDapps to filter the data by. It outputs both the total count of metering events that match filter in the time
window, and a breakdown of these events by the commands involved and the signing entities. This flow has been kept for invocation from the shell while its usage via RPC has been deprecated, use `NodeMeteringCollectionFlow` instead.
* `NodeMeteringCollectionFlow` is used to collect metering data from a node conncting to it via RPC. It takes in a time window over which to collect data, and optionally a set of CorDapps to filter the data by. It outputs both the total count of metering events that match filter in the time
window, and a breakdown of these events by the commands involved and the signing entities.
* `FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow` is analogue to `NodeMeteringCollectionFlow` except that collects data from another node in the network, hence
requires, as an additional parameter, the party running the node where metering data will be collected from.
* `AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow` is used to collect aggregated metering data from other nodes in the network. It takes in a time window
and the party running the node where metering data will be collected from. It ouputs only the total count of signing events that happened on that node in the specified time window.
* `MultiFilteredCollectionFlow` is analogous of `FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow` except that allows to collect data from 
multiple nodes in the network sequentially in a single flow and returns the result as a JSON string. It is meant to be only used from the node shell while there is a dedicated method,
`FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow#multiCollect`, for running collection from multiple nodes in parallel using from an RPC client.
* `MultiAggregatedCollectionFlow` is analogous of `AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow` except that allows to collect data from 
multiple nodes in the network sequentially in a single flow and returns the result as a JSON string. It is meant to be only used from the node shell while there is a dedicated method,
`AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow#multiCollect`, for running collection from multiple nodes in parallel using from an RPC client.
* `NotaryCollectionFlow` is used to collect metering data from notaries. It takes in a time window over which to collect the data. It
outputs a total count of notarisation requests over that interval, along with a breakdown of requests against the parties that made them.
* `RetrieveCordappDataFlow` is a utility flow to extract CorDapp hashes and signing keys for a given CorDapp name, in the correct format
for use in the `NodeMeteringCollectionFlow` filter. The flow provides information about the versions and vendors of the returned CorDapps so
that the correct CorDapp data can be selected.


{{< warning >}}
The `NotaryCollectionFlow` does not allow the collection of metering data for notaries configured in highly-available mode.
{{< /warning >}}

### Sharing of metering data
<a name="sharing-metering"></a>
The metering collector also contains responder flows that can be used by other nodes in the network to collect metering from the node where
this CorDapp is installed. This feature has to be enabled by the node operator deploying a 
[CorDapp configuration file](/docs/corda-os/4.5/cordapp-build-systems.html#cordapp-configuration-files) for this CorDapp, 
if no configuration file is deployed, metering data won't be shared with any other network party.
The following is an example configuration file to enable metering data sharing:
```json
"access_configuration" : {
    "network_collectors" : ["O=PartyA,L=New York,C=US", "O=PartyB,L=Zurich,C=CH"],
    "cordapp_collectors" : {
        "by_name" : {
            "Corda Finance Demo" : ["O=PartyB,L=Zurich,C=CH"]
        },
        "by_hash" : {
          "FC0150EFAB3BBD715BDAA7F67B4C4DB5E133D919B6860A3D3B4C6C7D3EFE25D5" : 
            ["O=PartyC,L=London,C=GB"],
          "44489E8918D7D8F7A3227FE56EC34BFDDF15BD413FF92F23E72DD5D543BD6194" : 
            ["O=PartyC,L=London,C=GB"]
        },
        "by_signature" : {
          "AA59D829F2CA8FDDF5ABEA40D815F937E3E54E572B65B93B5C216AE6594E7D6B" : 
            ["O=PartyD,L=Dublin,C=IE"]
        }
    }
}
```
This configuration allows `PartyA` and `PartyB` to collect [aggregated metering data](#using-AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow) from the node (
which means that only the total number of signing event that happened in a given time period will be shared), additionally 
`PartyB` will be allowed to collect detailed metering related to all installed CorDapps whose name **is** *Corda Finance Demo*.
`PartyC` is then allowed to collect detailed metering related to CorDapps whose jar hash is `FC0150EFAB3BBD715BDAA7F67B4C4DB5E133D919B6860A3D3B4C6C7D3EFE25D5`
or `44489E8918D7D8F7A3227FE56EC34BFDDF15BD413FF92F23E72DD5D543BD6194` and `PartyD` is allowed to collect detailed metering related to all CorDapp whose jar
has been signed with the key `AA59D829F2CA8FDDF5ABEA40D815F937E3E54E572B65B93B5C216AE6594E7D6B`. 
Use [`RetrieveCordappDataFlow`](#using-RetrieveCordappDataFlow) to get detailed information about the CorDapp deployed on your Corda 
node in order to write the configuration file correctly.

{{< warning >}}
There is a configuration validation step that runs at node startup that will check that the X.500 names contained in the configuration file 
are valid (from an X.500 standard perspective, they are not required to actually exist in the network) and that all the jar hashes, jar signature 
and CorDapp names in the configuration each match at least one of the deployed CorDapps 
(which means it is illegal to whitelist a CorDapp that doesn't exist). Any failure in the validation step will cause the node to fail startup.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< warning >}}
Make sure you do not make mistakes when you type the configuration file static keys (`access_configuration`, `network_collectors`, `by_hash`, etc) because that will simply
result in your configuration being ignored and default values being applied (which will in turn result in metering data not being shared).
{{< /warning >}}

### Using `MeteringCollectionFlow`

It is meant to be invoked from the shell, three things must be specified:

* A time window over which to run
* A filter to select which CorDapps to collect data for
* A paging specification to describe how the flow should access the database

To specify the time window, `MeteringCollectionFlow` takes either a start and end date (both of type `Instant`), or a start date and a duration.
Note that as metering data is only recorded with a time granularity of an hour, the flow will not be able to collect metering data over
durations shorter than an hour.

The filter is specified by providing a `MeteringFilter` object, which consists of a `filterBy` criteria and a list of strings that describe
the CorDapps to filter by. There are four possible options to filter by, which are described in the [data filtering section.](#data-filtering)

The paging specification is used to control database access by ensuring that only a subset of data is accessed at once. This is important to
prevent too much data being read into memory at once, resulting in out of memory errors. By default, 10000 metering entries are read into
memory at a time. (Note that under the covers some aggregation occurs, so the number of returned entries is likely to be less than this.) If
more than one page of data is required, the flow may need to be run multiple times to collect the full breakdown of metering events.
However, the total count provided is always the full number of signing events that match the supplied criteria.

##### Output Format

`MeteringCollectionFlow` outputs a data class that contains a structured representation of the metering data. The outputted data contains
the following:

* The total number of signing events that match the query provided
* The current version of the output metering data
* An object describing the query that produced this set of data. This includes the time window over which the data was collected, the
filter applied to the data, and the paging criteria used.
* A list of entries giving a breakdown of the metering data. Each entry contains a signing entity, a set of commands, a transaction type,
and a count of events in this page that match this specification.


The output object can also be serialized into JSON form, by calling `serialize`.


##### Usage

The shell interface allows to invoke the flow specifying the `startDate` and `endDate` for the collection in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`, or the `startDate` (in the same format)
and the number of `daysToCollect`. Then a filter can be specified according to the rules described in the filtering section
It is also possible to omit the filter entirely if all metering data is required. Note that the smallest time window that can be specified is a day.

When date strings are required, they are always in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the date does not parse correctly, an exception is thrown.

When the metering collector is run from the shell, the data is output to the terminal in JSON format.


##### Examples

Collecting all metering data over a particular week:

```bash
start MeteringCollectionFlow startDate: 2019-11-07, daysToCollect: 7, page: 1
```

Collecting metering data for a particular CorDapp:

```bash
start MeteringCollectionFlow startDate: 2019-11-07, endDate: 2019-11-14, filterBy: CORDAPP_NAMES, filter: ["Corda Finance Demo"], page: 1
```

An example of the output JSON on the shell is shown below:

```bash
{"totalCount":2,"version":1,"query":{"startDate":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","endDate":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","filter":{"filterBy":"NONE","values":[]},"pageNumber":1,"totalPages":1,"pageSize":10000},"entries":[{"signingId":{"type":"NODE_IDENTITY","accountId":null},"txType":"NORMAL","commands":["net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash.Commands.Issue"],"count":1},{"signingId":{"type":"NODE_IDENTITY","accountId":null},"txType":"NORMAL","commands":["net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash.Commands.Move"],"count":1}]}
```

### Using `NodeMeteringCollectionFlow`

This flow can be used to retrieve detailed metering from the node the RPC client connects to, it is analogous to `MeteringCollectionFlow` but it provides
a simpler API without requiring data pagination.
Note that the metering sharing configuration will not apply since it is expected that only the node operator is allowed to connect to the node via RPC.
This code snippet shows how to retrieve the metering data, from a node running on the local machine, for CorDapps *myCorDapp1* and *myCorDapp2* 
(as well as any other CorDapp whose name contains those two strings) for the last 7 days:

        client.use("rpcUsername", "rpcPassword", conn -> {
            CordaRPCOps rpcOps = conn.getProxy();

                            new Filter.Or(
                                    new Filter.ByCordapp.ByName("myCorDapp1"),
                                    new Filter.ByCordapp.ByName("myCorDapp2")
                            )
                    ));
            Future<NodeMeteringData> result = handle.getReturnValue();
            try {
                return result.get();
            } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        });

### Using `AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow`
<a name="using-AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow"></a>

This flow allows for collection of aggregated metering data from a remote node in the network. Aggregated meterings only contain the total number
of signing event that happened in a given time period, without any additional information (signer public key, contract command or transaction type).
Note that the resulting data will depends on what the node operator decided to share with you in his [CorDapp configuration](#sharing-metering), 
in particular your X.500 name needs to be present in his list of `network_collectors`, otherwise the invocation of 
this flow will throw `PermissionDeniedException`.
The following code snippet shows how to retrieve aggregated metering connecting to a node running on the local machine, 
from the node ran by `O=PartyA,L=New York,C=US` for the last 7 days:

{{< tabs name="tabs-AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow" >}}
{{% tab name="java" %}}
```java
NetworkHostAndPort hostAndPort = NetworkHostAndPort.parse("127.0.0.1:10000");
CordaRPCClient client = new CordaRPCClient(hostAndPort);
AggregatedNodeMeteringData meteringData =
        client.use("rpcUsername", "rpcPassword", conn -> {
            CordaRPCOps rpcOps = conn.getProxy();
            Party destination = rpcOps.wellKnownPartyFromX500Name(
                    CordaX500Name.parse("O=PartyA,L=New York,C=US")
            );
            Instant now = Instant.now();
            Instant sevenDaysAgo = now.minus(7, ChronoUnit.DAYS);
            FlowHandle<AggregatedNodeMeteringData> handle =
                    rpcOps.startFlowDynamic(AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow.class,
                            destination,
                            Filter.ByTimeStamp.between(sevenDaysAgo, now)
                    );
            Future<AggregatedNodeMeteringData> result = handle.getReturnValue();
            try {
                return result.get();
            } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        });

### Using `FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow`
<a name="using-FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow"></a>

This flow allows for collection of metering data from a remote node in the network. It is analogous to `NodeMeteringCollectionFlow` except
that it collects metering from a remote node in the network. 
Note that the resulting data will depends on what the node operator decided to share with you in his [CorDapp configuration](#sharing-metering), 
if this is not the case you will receive an object with an empty `entries` list. In order for the collector to distinguish between the case
where there were no metering data on the collected node and the case where the node operator dind't whitelist him,
 the returned object contains the `collectedCorDapps` field which will be populated with the list of CorDapp for which data has been collected.

If `collectedCorDapps` is an emtpy list, that means the requester was not authorized to collect metering data from any of the requested CorDapp, on the other
hand, if `entries` is empty but `collectedCorDapps` is not, it means that the CorDapp contained in `collectedCorDapps` have been collected but no metering data was present
 in the specified time window.

The following code snippet shows how to retrieve metering related to CorDapps *myCorDapp1* and *myCorDapp2*
(as well as any other CorDapp whose name contains those two strings) connecting to a node running on the local machine, 
from the node ran by `O=PartyA,L=New York,C=US` for the last 7 days:

### Using `RetrieveCordappDataFlow`
<a name="using-RetrieveCordappDataFlow"></a>
An additional utility flow is provided to retrieve CorDapp metadata for a particular CorDapp name: `RetrieveCordappDataFlow`. This can be
used to obtain CorDapp hashes and signing keys in the correct format in order to construct a valid `MeteringFilter` instance. 
It additionally returns the version numbers and vendors of the CorDapps, allowing the right hashes and keys to be found for particular versions.

Here is an example of the flow invocation from the node shell
```bash
Tue May 05 16:23:08 IST 2020>>> flow start com.r3.corda.metering.RetrieveCordappDataFlow

 âœ“ Starting

### Collection from multiple nodes

To address the common use case of having to collect metering data from multiple nodes in the network, two different mechanism are available:

- multiple nodes collection via RPC 
- multiple nodes collection via node shell 

#### Multiple collection using the Corda RPC API

Two methods are available:
- `FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow.multiCollect`
- `AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow.multicollect`

both of them start multiple parallel flows on the collector node, each of them collecting metering from a different node in the network, a timeout
can be specified so that all flows that do not terminate within the timeout are simply canceled and only the data from the flows that completed successfully will be processed.

The methods take as a parameter a callback will be invoked, once for each destination node, as soon as the relative flow returns, the callback takes as parameters
the destination Party from which data have been collected, the parameters that were used for the collection (an instance of `MeteringCollectionParameters` for
`FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow`, while a simple `MeteringCollectionTimeWindow` is used for `AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow`) and a `Future` that is guaranteed 
to be done at the time of the callback invocation; if the flow invocation resulted in an exception, that will be rethrown inside the callback when calling `Future.get` 
and it is expected that the callback is able to handle it, if this is not the case the execution will be interrupted and all the created subflows canceled.


The following is a code example for filtered metering collection from 2 nodes

{{< tabs name="tabs-FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow.multicollect" >}}
{{% tab name="java" %}}
```java
Instant now = Instant.now();
Instant sevenDaysAgo = now.minus(7, ChronoUnit.DAYS);

        Filter.ByTimeStamp.between(sevenDaysAgo, now),
        new Filter.Or(
                new Filter.ByCordapp.ByName("myCorDapp1"),
                new Filter.ByCordapp.ByName("myCorDapp2")
        )
);
CordaRPCOps rpcOps = conn.getProxy();
List<Pair<Party, Filter>> destinations =

                .map(CordaX500Name::parse)
                .map(rpcOps::wellKnownPartyFromX500Name)
                .map(party -> new Pair<>(party, filter))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow.FilteredResultConsumer consumer = (
        Party destination,
        Filter f,
        Future<FilteredNodeMeteringData> result
) -> {
    try {
        FilteredNodeMeteringData data = result.get();
        //do something with the data
    } catch (ExecutionException | InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
};
FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow.multiCollect(
        rpcOps,
        destinations,
        consumer,
        Duration.of(30, ChronoUnit.SECONDS));
```

#### Multiple nodes collection from the shell

Two flows are available: 
- `MultiAggregatedCollectionFlow` 
- `MultiFilteredCollectionFlow`

both of them are analogous to their single node counterparts, `AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow` and `FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow` respectively, in regard
of data filtering and permissions. 

They proceed sequentially through all the destination nodes, which can make the collection very slow and will cause the execution to hang indefinitely if one of the destination node is down
or is not running the metering collector CorDapp.

Both of them takes the following parameter when invoked from the shell

- `dateFormat` the date format to use for parsing [start] and [end], the syntax is the syntax of [SimpleDateFormat]
- `start` a string representing the start date from which metering data will be retrieved, the
 required format will be the one specified by [dateFormat] or the one returned by [SimpleDateFormat.getInstance],
 which defaults to your locale settings
- `end` a string representing the end date until which metering data will be retrieved
 required format will be the one specified by [dateFormat] or the one returned by [SimpleDateFormat.getInstance],
 which defaults to your locale settings
- `period` the period of time after `start` or before `end` that will be used for metering collection;
 "nanoseconds", "microseconds", "milliseconds", "seconds", "minutes", "hours", "days", "weeks", "months", "years" are all supported unit of measure, 
 as well as any unambiguous prefix for them (e.g `1mo` will be interpreted as one month while `1m` will throw an error). Any failure in this parameter 
 interpretation will raise `IllegalArgumentException`.
- `destinations` a list X.500 name of the parties running the nodes from which metering are intended to be collected, the names does not need to be
 the full qualified X.500 name since `IdentityService.partiesFromName` will be invoked on them and if more parties match input string, 
 metering data will be collected from all their nodes. If this parameter is omitted collection will proceed through all the nodes present 
 in the network map
 - `txTypes` a list of transaction types that will be included in the results, if it is omitted transactions of any type will be collected, see [the data filtering paragraph]("#data-filtering-shell")
 for more information about transaction types

- `filter` is only available for `MultiFilteredCollectionFlow` and allows to filter metering data by CorDapp, see also [the data filtering paragraph]("#data-filtering-shell")

Note that only two between `start`, `end` and `period` needs to be specified, if only `period` is provided, it will be implicitely interpreted as
an invocation with `period` and `end` with `end` set to the current timestamp.

{{< warning >}}
Due to limitations of the node shell (that could be addressed in the near future), the parameter `start`, `end`, `period`, `dateFormat` needs to be wrapped within an object
when created in the shell, e.g. `start : {value: "2020-06-01 05:45"}` instead of simply `start : "2020-06-01 05:45"`
{{< /warning >}}

##### Output format
For both of them, the result printed on the shell is a formatted JSON object whose keys are the `X.500` names of the destination nodes and the value is 
the JSON representation of object returned from the collection (an instance  of `AggregatedNodeMeteringData` for `MultiAggregatedCollectionFlow`, 
`FilteredNodeMeteringData` for `MultiFilteredCollectionFlow`). If any of the destination node throws an exception, 
you would see it in the response object.


##### Examples

###### Collecting aggregated metering data for last month from "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US" and "O=PartyA,L=New York,C=US"

```bash
Wed May 06 15:13:52 IST 2020>>> flow start com.r3.corda.metering.MultiAggregatedCollectionFlow period: {value: 1mon}, destinations: [PartyA, PartyB]

    },
    "O=PartyA, L=New York, C=US" : {
      "exception" : "net.corda.core.flows.FlowException",
      "message" : "com.r3.corda.metering.PermissionDeniedException: You don't have permission to collect aggregated metering from this node",

    "endInstant" : "2020-05-06T14:14:38.844Z"
  }
}
```
Note that even if `PartyA` threw `PermissionDeniedException` the collection continued successfully to `PartyB`.

A similar result could have been obtained by the following command lines
```

### Data filtering using the node shell
<a name="data-filtering-shell"></a>

The data filtering available from the shell is limited to filtering by CorDapp, by transaction type and by timestamp.

#### Filtering by CorDapp

It is done using the `filter` parameter in `MeteringCollectionFlow`, `MultiAggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow` and `MultiFilteredMeteringCollectionFlow`. The `filter` parameter requires an object created by the parameter `filterBy` that specify the type of filter and `values`, which is an array of strings that represents the filter argument. The following is a list of filters available for `filterBy`:


{{< table >}}

|`filterBy` criteria|Description|Data Collected|`Filter` requirement|
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|NONE|Returns data for all CorDapps|All data for a node|None|
|CORDAPP_NAMES|Returns data for CorDapps matching specified names|Data for all versions of a CorDapp|List of names, as specified in CorDapp build information|
|CORDAPP_HASHES|Returns data for any CorDapp with jar hash in list|Data for particular CorDapp versions|List of SHA256 hashes of CorDapp JAR files|
|SIGNING_KEYS|Returns data for all CorDapps signed with any key in list|Data for particular owner(s) of CorDapps|List of SHA256 hashes of public keys used to sign JAR files|

{{< /table >}}

#### Filtering by transaction type
It is done using the `txTypes` parameter in `MultiAggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow` and `MultiFilteredMeteringCollectionFlow`, it takes an array with all the types that will be included. 
The available transaction types are:

- `NORMAL`
- `CONTRACT_UPGRADE`
- `NOTARY_CHANGE`
- `UNKNOWN`

{{< note >}}
`NORMAL`, `CONTRACT_UPGRADE` and `NOTARY_CHANGE` corresponds to transactions that cause a ledger update, while `UNKNOWN` are transactions that do not cause a ledger update.
{{< /note >}}

### Data filtering using the RPC API
<a name="data-filtering-rpc"></a>

Data filtering is available for `NodeMeteringCollectionFlow`, `AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow` and `FilteredMeteringCollectionFlow`

{{< note >}}
Filtering by CorDapp is forbidden for `AggregatedMeteringCollectionFlow` and, if such a filter is provided (either directly or as part of a boolean filter) `WrongParameterException` will be raised.
{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
All the following classes belongs to package `com.r3.corda.metering.filter`
{{< /note >}}

{{< table >}}

|Class name|Description|
|-|-|
| ```Filter.Or``` | Represents the logical `or` of the filters provided as constructor parameters |
| ```Filter.And``` | Represents the logical `and` of the filters provided as constructor parameters |
| ```Filter.ByTimeStamp.Since``` | Matches only the meterings with a later timestamp than the one provided |
| ```Filter.ByTimeStamp.Until``` | Matches only the meterings with an earlier timestamp than the one provided |
| ```Filter.ByCorDapp.ByName``` | Matches only the meterings related to signing events generated by a CorDapp whose name contains the provided string |
| ```Filter.ByCorDapp.ByJarHash``` | Matches only the meterings related to signing events generated by a CorDapp whose jar hash matches the one provided |
| ```Filter.ByCorDapp.ByJarSignature``` | Matches only the meterings related to signing events generated by a CorDapp whose jar was signed with the provided public key |
| ```Filter.ByCorDapp.ByTransactionType``` | Matches only the meterings related to transactrion of the specified transaction type (helpers are available to specify ledger-updating transactions and non-ledger-updating transactions) |
